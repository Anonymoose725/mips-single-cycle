My MIPS processor handles basic instructions for data movement (load, store), arithmetic (add, addi / sub), 
logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), and program control flow operations (branch, jump).
The attached file keyboard.asm, written to be simulated in the MARS Simulator, takes in input using buffering to engage with
"external" devices such as a simulated keyboard.
